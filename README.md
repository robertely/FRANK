# jonathan schwartz loves frank sinatra

So, in New York there is a well known radio personality named Jonathan Schwartz. He was born in 1938 and it is well known that he loves Frank Sinatra. Since he controls the local NPR station on the weekends it means your probably goint to be hearing a lot of Sinatra. 

How much Sinatra ?

A lot, It turns out what WNYC keeps track of it's weekend playlists in RSS form(ish the data was entered by hand and is error prone). So on one lazy Sinatra filled afternoon we found out how much Schwartz actually played him. 

About a quarter of the time. *Fully one quarter of the songs he plays are by Frank Sinatra.*
